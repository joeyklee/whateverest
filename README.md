# Whateverest

A monorepo of ideas. Mostly random tools and packages and whatever. Whateverest is an excuse to learn through making, using yarn workspaces to try to manage the randomness. `Whateverest == zero expectations + all fun + some utility?`

## Developer notes

```sh
yarn workspaces run build
# yarn build
```

```
