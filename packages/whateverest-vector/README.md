# Whateverest-vector

This is basically an implementation of [P5.Vector](https://p5js.org/reference/p5/p5.Vector/) with no dependencies to P5. It diverges fundamentally from the P5 Vector class in that it always returns a new vector. So if you want to change the existing vector, your need to re-assign the vector to the new output.

Does it make sense to return a new vector each time? I'm not sure! Does it work though? Yes!

See the examples for more insight into the usage.
